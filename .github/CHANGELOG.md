## [Unreleased]

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **`scripts/sync-stats.py`** — content freshness pipeline; regenerates `public/content/stats.json` from actual file counts (blog posts, questions, exams, notes, scenarios, agents, tool routes in `App.tsx`)
- **`public/content/stats.json`** — live platform statistics; loaded by home page on mount; auto-updated by `sync-stats.py` after every content write; updated in STANDARD FLOW step 3b
- **`/docs` route** — new Platform Documentation page (`Docs.tsx`) with tab selector and Markdown renderer supporting Mermaid diagrams; 4 initial docs shipped
- **`public/content/platform-docs/`** — architecture guide, agent ecosystem reference, content schema, release notes
- **`platform-docs.agent.md`** v1.0.0 — new agent scoped to `public/content/platform-docs/`; wired into Staff Engineer STEP 3 routing

### Changed
- `HomeV2.tsx` — proof bar (`Articles`, `Practice Qs`, `Dev Tools`) and feature card bullets now driven dynamically by `stats.json`; hardcoded values used as fallback only
- Staff Engineer v2.3.0 — content-sync step (3b) added to STANDARD FLOW; Platform Docs routing added to STEP 3; modeInstructions updated to match
- `registry.json` — `platform_version` bumped to `2.3.0`; staff-engineer entry updated; platform-docs entry added

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **`agents-validate.yml`** — CI gate on every `.github/agents/*.agent.md` change: validates `version:` + `last_modified:` fields, blocks PR merge if version was not bumped vs base branch, regenerates `registry.json` on push to main (items 16)
- **`public/content/agents/registry.json`** — committed agent registry; single source of truth for all 21 agent versions, readable by the UI; auto-updated by `agents-validate.yml`, frozen per stable release by `release.yml` (item 17)
- **`release.yml` deployment dispatch (step 11)** — stable releases auto-dispatch `deploy.yml` on `main` via `gh workflow run`; pre-releases are excluded; requires `actions: write` permission (item 14)
- **`release.yml` rich job summary (step 12)** — structured table in `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` with release status, date, commit SHA, release URL, artifact size, agent count, and deployment status (item 14)
- **`release.yml` registry freeze (step 9)** — on stable tag push, regenerates `registry.json` with `platform_version` set to the release tag and commits back to `main [skip ci]` (item 18)

### Changed
- **`release.yml`** upgraded from 5 → 12 steps: concurrency guard, build artifact + SHA256 checksum, release header, commit log since previous stable tag, duplicate release guard, `--latest` flag, deployment dispatch, rich job summary (items 13–15)
- **`sre.agent.md`** bumped to `v1.2.0`: owns `agents-validate.yml`, `registry.json`, Hard Rules 8+9 (no bypass of agent gate, registry is automation-owned)
- **`qa-engineer.agent.md`** — added missing `version: 1.0.0` and `last_modified: 2026-05-29` fields (was blocking `agents-validate.yml` gate)
- Platform renamed to **"Aarya — My AI Learning Hub"** across all agents, workflows, 404 page, CHANGELOG
- Six page redesigns: `Notes.tsx`, `Progress.tsx`, `ExamHome.tsx`, `Scenarios.tsx`, `ExamCatalog.tsx`, `Quiz.tsx`

- `/team/v2` alias removed (traffic now goes directly to `/team`)
